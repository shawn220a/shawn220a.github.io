            My name is Shawn Tschoepe and I am currently the Director of Business Development at Southwest Education.
            While I am at work I do some sells but mostly I look for educational programs and try and see if they will fit into our company slogan.
            I have done some programming since high school. I have coded with Visual Basic, C++, Python, and JavaScript. I have been in my off time going to my local airport
            and trying to receive all the pilot ratings. I currently have my private license and have been on the National Intercollegiate Flight Team since 2016. While I was part of the team I was the captain and went to nationals three years in a row.
